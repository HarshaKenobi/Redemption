You feel (option chosen). Alice is the one person who truly knows what's going on in your head. And you don't mean that in the metaphorical romantic way. You mean it as a your-wife-is-a-psychiatrist-and-your-were-her-patient kind of way. You were raving mad when you met her - you are told that you hurled a chair at her in your second session and kept begging her to kill you. A severe case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - but what is the trauma, one might wonder. That's the thing. You have no idea. 

You couldn't help but fall in love with her. After your discharge, you met a lot of people - building an idea of how people are and how the world is. You realised she was the most beautiful of all.
